\large Section 2 [Q1.1]: Create Random Walk and personalised page rank functions

\normalsize 

Q1.1 Extract a word association sub-network around each pair of words by sampling the
graph in the vicinity of each word. The sub-network for each pair of words should be
between 100 and 200 words. The objective is to build a word association network around
your pair of words that will capture all the semantic contexts your target words belong to â€“
without bringing in irrelevant contexts.

\large Section 3.1 [Q1.2]: Analysis of network and effects of Personalised Page Rank and 
Random walk on association network creation.

\normalsize 

Three word pairs choose to create word network, they are "Court and Lawyer", "Children and Parents", and "King and Royal". For creating the word association network, random walk algorithm was used for "Court and Lawyer" pair, and personalised pagerank algorithm was used for the other two pairs, The reason for choosing these specific algorithms were that they were optimal in creating word association network that would generate communities that were relatively coherent compared to others.

For Random Walk it was observed that as the number of walks and size of vertices increases, it increases the size of communities formed later during community detection and hence the number of walks for the one pair is restricted to 40 walks and 160 vertices.

For Personalised Page Rank every time nodes are ranked randomly some nodes are given more weight so that there is a chance for other nodes to be more relevant based on the damping factor, it was found that a high damping factor yields better results on community detection, i.e more communities of ideal size and coherent nodes.


\large Section 3.2 [Q1.2]: Analysis of Centrality Measures on the word association networks.

\normalsize

Words of similar contexts seem to be appearing in the subgraph (association networks) created
using both random walk algorithm and personalised page rank algorithm. The words from the word
pairs seem to be top words based on centrality and authority measures as they are the root 
words used to generate the association networks this virtue of the networks makes sense. 
For example, for the first network generated using words "Court and Lawyers" seems to have
both court and lawyer appear high on all of the centraility measures. Whereas, for the 
other two networks the words do appear in the list but they don't seem to have the same level
of centraility attribute as the first word network. This maybe because, the first network
was created using random walk whereas the later two where created using personalised page
rank.

\large Section 5: Detect and display community tables

\normalsize

Q2.1 Using an appropriate community detection algorithm, determine the communities in
each of the three word association networks you created in Part 1. You are expected to
evaluate different community detection algorithms and you should justify the one you have
selected.

Q2.2 Produce a table listing the words in each community. You should do this using a table
formatting package such as Kable.

\large Section 5.1 [Q2.1, Q2.2] : 

\normalsize

Various community detection algorithms were simulated on the association networks 
created on part 1. 

Like the fast-greedy algorithm that joins pairs of granular 
communities if the move increases the combined community modularity in an iterative
process. 

Label Propogation algorithm, where every nodes are initally labelled and then iteratively
each node adopts the label that the maximum number of its neighbors belong to, thus 
communities are formed in densely connected regions in the graph.

Louvain Alogirthm which follows a bottom-up approach, where initally there are smaller
set of communities which are converged using agglomerative clustering in two phases
Identification of communites (based on modularity maximization) and folding of those communities.

Walktrap Algorithm, where the probability of distribution of a random walker reaching other
nodes in the graph is considered  while deciding whether two nodes should belong to same
community or not.

Other that these algorithm based in module, fluid communities algorithm[1] was also tried out
on word pair networks. Idea behind this approach is to think of nodes as fluids interacting in 
the network. Also, it allows us to identify a arbitary number of communities as a parameter
to our algorithm. 

After a lot of trial and error it was found that the clustering algorithms set on word pair
association networks above givee the better results. Modularity of the clustering network
and context of the communities founds were used to quantify if the community  detections
results were good.
