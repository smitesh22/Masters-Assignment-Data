In general, these improvements will differ between students (or student groups). **The proposed improvement must be notified to the lecturer at least 1 week before submission, and approved by the lecturer**. If working in a group, the two members of the group should not work on different topics in Part 5: they must work on the same topic and submit identical submissions.\n",

A student may not work together in a group with any student they have previously worked on a group project with, in this module or any other in the MSc programme. **Groups must be notified to the lecturer in writing before beginning work and at least 1 week before submission.** If working in a group, both students must submit and both submissions must be identical. If working in a group, both students may be asked to explain any aspect of the code in interview (see below), therefore working independently on separate components is not recommended.

You may use snippets of code (eg 1-2 lines) from the internet, **if you provide a citation with URL**. You may also use a longer snippet of code if it is a utility function, again only with citation. You may not use code from the internet to carry out the core of the assignment. You may not use a large language model to generate code.\n",

Interviews will be held in-person (CT5133) or online (CT5145). Interviews will last approximately 10 minutes. The purpose of interviews will be to assess students' understanding of their own submission.\n"
