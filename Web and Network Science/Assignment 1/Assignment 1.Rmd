## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(igraph)
dib_graph<-read.graph("dib2.graphml",format="graphml")

```
```{r}
cat("num vertices:", vcount(dib_graph), "\n")

cat("num edges :", ecount(dib_graph), "\n")
```

```{r}
cat(components(dib_graph, mode="strong")$csize)
cat(components(dib_graph, mode="weak")$csize)
```

```{r}
diameter(dib_graph, directed = T, unconnected = TRUE, weights=NA)
```

```{r}
cat("average path length :", mean_distance(dib_graph, directed = T), "\n")
```

```{r}
cat("clustering coeff :", transitivity(dib_graph, type="localaverage"), "\n")
```

```{r}
deg<-degree(dib_graph, mode = "in")

hist(deg, 
     breaks=(min(deg)-1):(max(deg))+0.5,
     freq=FALSE, 
     xlab = "in-degree", 
     ylab = "proportion", 
     main = "Histogram of In-Degree Distribution",
     border="#80b1d3", 
     col="#8dd3c7", 
     xlim=c(0,max(deg)),
     ylim=c(0,0.06))
```

```{r}
deg<-degree(dib_graph, mode = "out")

hist(deg, 
     breaks=(min(deg)-1):(max(deg))+0.5,
     freq=FALSE, 
     xlab = "in-degree", 
     ylab = "proportion", 
     main = "Histogram of In-Degree Distribution",
     border="#80b1d3", 
     col="#8dd3c7", 
     xlim=c(0,max(deg)),
     ylim=c(0,0.06))
