From a command prompt, this will usually look like \"`pip install nltk`\", or \"`conda install nltk`\" if you're using Anaconda. You can also run these commands in the notebook itself: typing `!` in a code cell before the command tells Jupyter it should be executed in the console (remember `!curl` in the previous excercise sheet?). \n",

The \"`1`\" indicates it's the first cell to have been executed. Note that you can queue cells for execution, and they'll all show a `[*]` until they've executed."
