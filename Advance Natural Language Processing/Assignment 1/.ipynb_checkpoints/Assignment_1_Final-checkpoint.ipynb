    "For this assignment, we will explore Twitter Emotion Classification. The goal is the identify the primary emotion expressed in a tweet. Consider the following tweets:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Tweet 1: @NationalGallery @ThePoldarkian I have always loved this painting.\n",
    "Tweet 2: '@tateliverpool #BobandRoberta: I am angry more artists that have a profile are not speaking up #foundationcourses.'\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "How would you describe the emotions in `Tweet 1` vs `Tweet 2`? `Tweet 1` expresses enjoyment and happiness, while `Tweet 2` directly expresses anger. For this assignment, we will be working with the SMILE Twitter Emotion Dataset ([Wang et al. 2016](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1619/paper3.pdf)). At a high level, our goal is to develop different models (rule-based, machine learning, and deep learning), which can be used to identify the emotion of a tweet. You will be required to clean and preprocess the data, generate features for classification, train various models, and evaluate the models. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a dataset, let's work on developing some solutions for emotion classification. We'll start with implementing a simple rule-based classifier which will also serve as our naive baseline. Emotive language (e.g. awesome, feel great, super happy) can be a strong signal as to the overall emotion being by the tweet. For each emotion in our label space (happy, surprised, sad, angry) we will generate a set of words and phrases that are often associated with that emotion. At classification time, the classifier will calculate a score based on the overlap between the words in the tweet and the emotive words and phrases for each of the emotions. The emotion label with the highest overlap will be selected as the prediction and if there is no match the \"no-emotion\" label will be predicted. We can break the implementation of this rules-based classifier into three steps:\n",
    "1. Emotive language extraction from train examples \n",
    "2. Developing a scoring algorithm\n",
    "3. Building the end-to-end classification flow \n",

    "### Task 2a. Emotive Language Extraction [4 points] \n",
    "For this task you will generate a set of unigrams and bigrams that will be used to predict each of the labels. Using the training data you will need to extract all the unique unigrams and bigrams associated with each label (excluding no-emotion). Then you should ensure that the extracted terms for each emotion label do not appear in the other lists. In the real world, you would then manually curate the generated lists to ensure that associated words were useful and emotive. For the assignment, you won't be required to further curate the generated lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've identified the appropiate terms, save them as lists stored in the following environment variables: `happy_words`, `surprised_words`, `sad_words`,and `angry_words`. To get full credit for this section, ensure all 2a Tests pass. \n",
    "\n",

    "- We suggest you use Python's [set methods](https://realpython.com/python-sets/) for this task.\n",
    "- NLTK has a function for extracting [ngrams](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.util.html?highlight=ngrams#nltk.util.ngrams). This function expects a list of tokens as input and will output tuples which you'll need to reconvert into strings. "

    "\n",
    "DistilBERT would be the most appropriate choice to recommend. It is a pretrained model based on the bidirectional transformer(BERT), but it is much faster and smaller in size although it loses some of BERT's robustness as a tradeoff. The random forest classifier with 100 estimators(trees) was able to perform well compared to our baseline rule-based model, but it was unable to predict class sad and suprise. Theses classes have really less support(no of samples belonging to a particular class). Additionally, random forest works better with POS-tags as POS tags would be helpful to differentiate between two phrases with different parts of speech i.e the context of the phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-accuracy: It is the F1-score of the whole test set at once. Also referred as micro-average \\\n",
    "F1-macro: It is the average of the F1-score of the each class set. \\\n",
    "F1-weighted : Same as macro but you weight the score of each class with its corresponding support \\\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rule-based classifier is the baseline model we developed to compare with other models. It performed with f1-micro score of 0.52, that means if a model two classes predicts a single class every time it would perform similar to the rule-based model, i.e. not to accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random-Forest classifer with TF-IDF vector shows improvement in prediction with 0.68 f1-micro without and 0.76 with POS tags. However F1-macro of the model is less as it is not able to predict sad and surprise emotions. As the support for these labels are less it doesn't affect the f1-weighted score on the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DistilBERT performed the best with 0.84 f1-micro. It was better on f1-macro and f1-weighted scores as well. As support for sad and suprise is less (emotion classes are imbalanced) it would be harder to predict those emotions which is reflected in the f1-scores of these classes. A solution could be to undersampling to take less samples for other class but that could lead to less data to train on and underfitting.\n",
