    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This file contains a number of Python functions for finding the maximal flow through a network $G$ subject to minimal cost using the Ford Fulkerson Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network graph $G$ is stored in a set `G` of two element tuples `(i,j)` describing the directed arcs $(i,j)$ of $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that node number $1$ is the source and the greatest node `Nsink` is the sink.  \n",
    "Thus `G={(1,2),(2,3),(1,3)}`  describes a network with 3 nodes where node 1 is the source and node 3 is the sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "The capacity $c(i,j)$, flow $\\phi(i,j)$ and cost $l(i,j)$ of the arc $(i,j)$ of $G$ are stored in `c[i][j]`, `phi[i][j]` and `l[i][j]`. \n",
    "Here `c`, `phi` and `l` are Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Functions\n",
    "### The `Initialise(G)` function\n",
    "Having defined the network $G$, initialise `c`, `phi` and `l` values to zero via the `Initialise` function before defining their values in any particular example.  The global variable `Nsink`,  the sink node of $G$, is also found by the `Initialise` function .\n",
    "\n",
    "### The main `Iterate(G)`function \n",
    "This implements the full algorithm to find the maximum flow with minimal cost. "

    "## The `Iterate(G)` function is based on a number of other Python functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Flows(G)` \n",
    "This checks for conservation of flow and prints out all of the current flows for G and the total cost of this flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "###  `Links(G)`\n",
    "This finds all arcs `(i,j1)`, ` (i,j2)`,  ... *out* of node `i` of `G`.  The nodes `j1,j2,..` are stored in a global list of sets `Out`.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  `SourceSink(G)`\n",
    "This finds all of the paths from source to sink in any network `G` and results in a global set `SinkPaths` of such paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  `IncremNet(G)`\n",
    "This finds the Incremental Network `Gp` associated with the current flow of the network `G`.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  `Newflows(G)`\n",
    "This updates the flows `phi` of `G` according to the best chain found through `Gp`. If the maximal flow is reached, then this is indicated and the maximum flow value is outputed. Otherwise, the output is: the change in flow (`eps`), the cost of the best chain, and the best chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  `Iterate(G)`\n",
    "Implements the full algorithm to find the maximum flow with minimal cost. \n",
    "The output is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The incremental network `Gp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) The paths through `Gp` from source to sink. \n",
